BAG3++ Points of Contact
========================

BAG3++ is an open source software developed and maintained solely by a small group of hardware
design engineering graduate students. Hence we welcome constructive feedback and bug fixes for
improving our codebase, workspace organization, documentation, etc, all of which are in active
development.

The most preferred mode of submitting feedback is providing a solution for the offending problem
by creating a pull request to the specific GitHub repository. In case providing a solution is not
possible, the second preferred mode is to create an issue on the specific GitHub repository.
Please remember to include a test example so that we can verify the solution and / or reproduce
the error ourselves.

A list of the graduate students with significant development contributions to the overall BAG3++
project is given below:
